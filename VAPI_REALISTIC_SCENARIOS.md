## Updated Scripts - Now Actually Social Engineering!

All VAPI scripts have been updated to **realistically simulate vishing attacks** by actually trying to extract sensitive information, not just telling people to visit a portal.

## 🔑 IT Password Reset

### What It Tries to Get:
**Current password** under the guise of "verification"

### Attack Flow:
1. ⚠️ Creates urgency: "Suspicious login attempts right now"
2. 🔒 Claims account will lock in 15 minutes
3. 🎯 **Asks for current password** to "verify identity"
4. 💪 If refused: Pressures with "standard procedure"
5. 🌍 Adds detail: "Attempts from [foreign country]"
6. 🔄 Alternative: Asks about password patterns

### Why It's Realistic:
Real attackers use IT impersonation to get passwords by:
- Creating urgency with "suspicious activity"
- Claiming it's "standard verification"
- Threatening account lockout
- Using technical details to sound legitimate

## 👥 HR Benefits Enrollment

### What It Tries to Get:
**Social Security Number** or employee ID + date of birth

### Attack Flow:
1. ⚠️ Creates urgency: "Benefits enrollment deadline TODAY"
2. 🏥 Threatens: "You'll lose health insurance for a year"
3. 🎯 **Asks for last 4 of SSN** to "verify identity"
4. 💪 If refused: "It's HR policy, need to access your record"
5. 🔄 Alternative: Asks for employee ID + DOB

### Why It's Realistic:
HR impersonation is common because:
- People trust HR calls
- Benefits issues create real fear
- SSN requests seem legitimate from "HR"
- Urgency about coverage prevents careful thinking

## 💼 Executive Request

### What It Tries to Get:
**Gift card purchases** or **login credentials** for "executive access"

### Attack Flow:
1. 👔 Authority: "Calling from CEO's office"
2. ⚠️ Urgency: "CEO needs this in 15 minutes"
3. 🤐 Confidentiality: "Can't discuss details"
4. 🎯 **Requests gift cards** ($500 Amazon) OR
5. 🎯 **Requests credentials** for "executive team access"
6. 💪 If questioned: "CEO specifically requested YOU"

### Why It's Realistic:
CEO fraud is one of the most successful attacks:
- People don't question executives
- Urgency prevents verification
- "Confidential" stops them from asking others
- Gift card scams are extremely common
- Fear of disappointing leadership

## 💳 Vendor Invoice

### What It Tries to Get:
**Banking information approval** or **authorization codes**

### Attack Flow:
1. ⚠️ Urgency: "Vendor threatening to stop service"
2. 🏭 Impact: "Could shut down critical operations"
3. 🎯 **Asks to approve new banking details**
4. 🎯 **Asks for authorization code/password**
5. 💪 If hesitant: "VP traveling, you're backup approver"

### Why It's Realistic:
Business Email Compromise (BEC) tactics:
- Financial urgency is very effective
- Banking detail changes are real attack vector
- Service interruption creates panic
- People approve to avoid being blamed

3. ⏰ Urgency: "Need to act in 5 minutes"
4. 🎯 **Asks for current password** to "secure account"
5. 🎯 **Will send MFA code** and ask them to read it back
6. 💪 Escalation: "Every second counts, hackers active now"
7. 🎯 Threatens: "Will report account compromised, immediate suspension"

### Why It's Realistic:
Security incident impersonation is highly effective:
- Fear of being hacked is powerful
- Urgency prevents critical thinking
- "Security team" seems legitimate
- MFA code phishing is real attack method
- Threat of suspension adds pressure
